pianobar
========

pianobar is a modified version of PromyLOPh/pianobar that will store played music
on disk if you have the following config variable set:

    download = /path/to/download/directory

In addition, you can configure the artist/album/title separator and whether the filename is
"normalized" with the following

    download_separator = ___
    download_safe_filename = 1

The default separator is '---' and by default no filename normalizing takes place

Music is saved in a directory corresponding to the radio station. Unloved music (not-favorited)
is stored in the 'unloved' directory. The structure for a "Blue States Radio" station would look something
like this, for example:

    /Users/alice/Download/Blue\ States\ Radio/*.aac # Loved music files
    /Users/alice/Download/Blue\ States\ Radio/unloved/*.aac # Unloved music files

Favoriting in the middle of playback *will* put the music file in the right location, as you would expect
